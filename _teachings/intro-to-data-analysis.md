## Course Overview
This course provides a rigorous introduction to quantitative approaches to data analysis through descriptive and inferential perspectives. Topics include descriptive summaries of data, graphical representations, probability distributions, correlation, simple regression, hypothesis testing, and introduction to special topics of regression, factor analysis, and non-normal data distributions. Students will develop the knowledge and skills to analyze and interpret the data and report the findings to inform practical decisions based on context-specific needs. Students will learn to select appropriate statistical procedures, calculate statistics, and perform statistical tests by hand and through SPSS, interpret and write-up results.

## Course Format
This class is scheduled as an in-person class; although, a few times this semester, as needed (e.g., due to professional travel) we will be meeting remotely during our scheduled day and time via Zoom. Work will include presentations covering course content (e.g., modules as organized around book chapters and other readings), demonstrations of and applied practice with statistical software, in- and out-of-class activities and homework assignments, and a final take-home assignment. Modules should be completed in sequential order (i.e., Module 0, Module 1, … Module 18).

## Prerequisites
None, although a decent foundation in mathematics is desired
