## Course Overview
"Nature and Society: An Introduction to Environmental Studies" is a science-based exploration of the critical environmental issues that define our time, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and resource depletion. The course emphasizes the application of scientific thinking to understand earth's systems, assess human impacts on ecosystems, and explore sustainable solutions for the future. Through the integration of natural sciences and interdisciplinary insights from history, politics, sociology, and economics, students will gain a deeper understanding of how past societal choices have shaped our current environmental conditions and how scientific evidence can guide future sustainability efforts. This course empowers students to apply scientific principles and methodologies to analyze and propose practical solutions for global environmental challenges.
