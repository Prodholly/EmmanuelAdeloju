## Course Overview
"Nature and Society: An Introduction to Environmental Studies" is a science-based exploration of the critical environmental issues that define our time, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and resource depletion. The course emphasizes the application of scientific thinking to understand earth's systems, assess human impacts on ecosystems, and explore sustainable solutions for the future. Through the integration of natural sciences and interdisciplinary insights from history, politics, sociology, and economics, students will gain a deeper understanding of how past societal choices have shaped our current environmental conditions and how scientific evidence can guide future sustainability efforts. This course empowers students to apply scientific principles and methodologies to analyze and propose practical solutions for global environmental challenges.

Course Assignments
Please Note: The major assignments for this course will be automatically routed through Turnitin, a web-based plagiarism detection service. This service generates an originality report that identifies all material in the student paper that appears to 
be derived from other sources, including both sources that are properly acknowledged and cited and any that are not. The report will be reviewed before your assignment is graded. All work is to be original.

Grade Posting
All grades will be posted on Canvas at myasucourses.asu.edu. You have five (5) days after a due date to dispute an entry or request access to a closed assignment. After the five-day period, the grade stands as entered, and you will not be allowed to make up a missed assignment. If you do not complete an assignment before the deadline, you will see a zero for that item in the grade center. Check your grades regularly. See the tentative schedule that describes the value of assignments, the total points available for this course, and the distribution of final letter grades. No items are weighted— your grade is based solely on total points received.
